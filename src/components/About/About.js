                        I'm Ayush! -  software developer, with a passion for technology and learning. Always enthusiastic by a new idea, and willingness to contribute towards a valuable end product is what pushes me.

                        I got introduced to the programming in 11th standard when I opted for computer science as an optional subject. I end up scoring <i>17/100</i> marks in my final exam. I failed because things were not making sense. I had too many questions, how come 1+1 is 0, and why <i>a=10</i> works but <i>10=a</i> doesn't, why do we need <i>++a</i> when we have <i>a++</i>. All these things were very complex for a 15-year old child but, after some time everything started to make sense and once I got over the hump I haven't looked back. I got in touch with newer and more modern technologies like Machine Learning, Cloud, Web-development and I just fell in love with programming all over again, after that is still the challenges that get me going.

                        This website is an effort to showcase my fun side projects, skills, that I have developed over the years and continue to do so. You can view the source code of this website&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ayushagg31/portfolio-app" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style={{ textDecoration: 'none', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#999999' }}>here</a>, as such, the code is messy and best practices aren't always followed. I am working to make the code more elegant and beautiful. PRs and issue reports are most welcome.
